## 1. Introduction
Fresh Farm AI is an advanced **AI-powered crop quality control system** designed to assist farmers and agricultural businesses in efficiently assessing crop quality. By leveraging **image processing and deep learning**, the system automates the process of detecting defective produce, improving accuracy, and reducing time and labor costs.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional methods of crop quality control rely heavily on manual inspection, which is prone to **human errors, inconsistencies, and time delays**. With increasing demand for precision and efficiency in agriculture, an **AI-based automated solution** can significantly enhance productivity and quality assessment.

## 3. Proposed Solution
Fresh Farm AI aims to:
- Utilize **machine learning** and **image processing** to classify crops as "Good" or "Defective."
- Provide a **real-time quality assessment system** via a web interface.
- Offer a **REST API** for integration with agricultural software.
- Minimize **manual errors and inconsistencies** in the quality evaluation process.

## 4. Project Objectives
- Develop a **deep learning model** capable of detecting defects in crops.
- Build a **user-friendly web interface** for farmers to upload images.
- Implement a **RESTful API** to facilitate automated quality control.
- Ensure high **accuracy, scalability, and efficiency** of the system.
